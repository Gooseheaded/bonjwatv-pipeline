# Session — 2025-09-13

## Context
- Stabilize translator pipeline tests and bump GUI version label.
- Environment: local dev; network disabled; unit tests executed via venv.

## Changes
- Fixed IndentationError and provider branching in `translator/transcribe_audio.py`.
- Reordered preflight hash check before trivial-content validation in `translator/submit_to_catalog.py`.
- Adjusted tests to reflect validator behavior and preflight flow.
- Bumped translator GUI version label to `v250913` in `translator/gui/app.py`.

## Decisions
- Keep OpenAI SRT output unmodified; only normalize for local transcriptions.
- Treat identical-contents preflight as a non-error skip even if local file would be considered trivial.

## Next Steps
- Add CLI flags for validator thresholds and chunk sizes.
- Consider resume support for failed STT items and verbose decision logs.

## Links
- Related tests: `translator/tests/test_transcribe_audio.py`, `translator/tests/test_submit_preflight.py`.
