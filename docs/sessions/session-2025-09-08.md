# Session — 2025-09-08

## Context
- Continued API-first migration for the webapp (removed local videos.json sources).
- Added ratings-based sorting to Catalog API and integrated with webapp paging.
- Investigated and addressed bundle size growth across deployments.
- Fixed production 404s on watch/search by adding missing API route and aligning webapp routing.
- Resolved mixed content/CORS for subtitles via server-side proxy and auto-mirroring.
- Secured uploads with token auth; ensured login/session cookies persist across deploys.

## Changes
- Translator: submit uses run-root enriched JSON; fallback to .cache title; removed fallback to original non-EN title.
- Webapp: Admin Batch-Tag page (/Admin/BatchTag) + new tag “Story time”; persistent DataProtection keys (volume-backed).
- Webapp: API-first VideoService; added paged API calls; removed local JSON loader/watcher; fixed ratings display on Home/Search.
- Catalog API: added sortBy=rating_desc (Wilson LB) and Red/Yellow/Green aggregates in list payloads.
- API: added GET /api/videos/{id} and /healthz; fixed watch/search 404s.
- Webapp UI: Index/Search render rating counts inline; removed client JS fetch and client-side sort.
- Subtitles: added webapp proxy /subtitles/{id}/{version}.srt with external fallback; auto-mirrors legacy SRTs to API on first access.
- Security: secured API upload endpoint with X-Api-Key; webapp uses LEGACY_SUBTITLE_API_TOKEN (renamed) for mirroring.
- Build/Size: switched Dockerfiles to dotnet 9 alpine; added .dockerignore to shrink context; added measurement script.

## Decisions
- Catalog API is the single source of truth for videos; webapp depends on API for all data.
- Delegate ratings sort to API; homepage/search use API paging + sorting.
- Mirror legacy subtitles to first-party on-demand; prefer first-party URLs thereafter.
- Secure uploads via token (API_INGEST_TOKENS on API, LEGACY_SUBTITLE_API_TOKEN on webapp).
- Persist Data Protection keys to retain auth cookies across deploys.

## Image Size Measurement (Plan + Commands)
- Rebuild images clean:
  - `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml build --no-cache`
- Record sizes:
  - `docker images | grep -E 'bwkt-webapp|bwkt-catalog-api'`
  - `docker history bwkt-webapp:prod`
  - `docker history bwkt-catalog-api:prod`
- Package and record bundle size:
  - `scripts/package-docker.sh`
  - `ls -lh dist/bwkt-docker-*.tar.gz | tail -n1`
- Paste outputs here: docs/logs/docker-sizes-2025-09-08.txt

## Next Steps
- Optional: add /readyz to API for infra readiness checks.
- Optional: background job/admin tool to bulk-mirror all legacy external subtitles.
- Add metrics/logging around subtitle mirroring for visibility.
- Verify prod .env sets matching tokens (API_INGEST_TOKENS, LEGACY_SUBTITLE_API_TOKEN).
- Consider distroless/chiseled images if more savings are needed; monitor bundle size (target ~180–200MB).
