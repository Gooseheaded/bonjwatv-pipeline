# BWKT Monorepo — Session Summary (2025-09-05)

## Context

- Pagination in the webapp appears broken: changing pages does not alter results or links behave unexpectedly.
- Environment: dev and prod parity suspected; recent changes include API wiring and pagination features on Index/Search.

## Changes

- Authored a diagnosis and testing plan to isolate the pagination regression and prevent recurrence.

## Decisions

- Add targeted unit and integration tests around pagination parameters, link generation, and API-backed mode request shaping.
- Verify and align parameter naming between webapp and catalog-api (e.g., `pageNum` vs `page`).

## Next Steps

- Reproduce issue locally; collect examples (home and search, with/without query `q`).
- Inspect Index/Search PageModels for parsing/clamping of `pageNum`/`pageSize` and link generation.
- Validate service layer paging (in-memory vs API-backed) and parameter names sent to the API.
- Implement tests (unit + integration) to capture expected behavior and guard against regressions.
- Apply minimal fix; re-run tests; manual browser verification.
