# Session — 2025-12-06-b

## Context
- Dev session to stabilize the new subtitle correction workflow and fix a regression where watched cards became unclickable in the grid views. Verified via local `dotnet build`.

## Changes
- Updated the watched overlay CSS so the shading/badge no longer intercept pointer events, restoring clickability for watched cards.
- Hardened `corrections.js` to reuse the Bootstrap modal instance when hiding after a successful submission.
- Fixed Razor literal rendering by wrapping the `v@(…)` expressions for correction versions on the admin list/detail pages and the watch-page contributor banner.
- Ran targeted `dotnet build` on `webapp` and `catalog-api` to ensure the Razor changes compile.

## Decisions
- Treat the modal hide failure as non-blocking: log a warning instead of throwing so corrections can still succeed even if Bootstrap isn’t available.
- Prefer inline Razor formatting fixes over helper methods for now to keep the diff minimal while the broader admin UI continues to evolve.

## Next Steps
- Browser-verify the admin submission page and watch page in staging/prod so we can confirm the literal text no longer appears and the modal closes smoothly.
- Add automated coverage (unit/integration or Playwright) around the correction submission flow once the UI stabilizes.
