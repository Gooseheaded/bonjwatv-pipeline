# Session — 2026-02-23

## Context
- Planned and implemented watch-page UX improvements for subtitle usability in dev:
  - logged-in-only faux fullscreen "Theater Mode" with page dimming
  - subtitle repositioning controls (presets + vertical slider + reset)

## Changes
- Added watch-page theater mode shell/backdrop/toggle UI in `webapp/Pages/Watch.cshtml`.
- Added theater mode styles (lights-off backdrop, promoted player shell, responsive sizing, reduced motion) in `webapp/wwwroot/css/site.css`.
- Added `webapp/wwwroot/js/watch-theater.js` for theater mode toggle, `Esc`/backdrop exit, scroll restore, and GA enter/exit events.
- Added subtitle position controls (Low/Mid/High presets, vertical slider, reset) to `webapp/Pages/Watch.cshtml`.
- Added client-side subtitle position persistence (`localStorage`) and live application to `#subtitle-container` in `webapp/Pages/Watch.cshtml`.
- Verified with `dotnet build webapp/bwkt-webapp.csproj` (build succeeds; existing nullable warning in `VideoService.cs` remains).

## Decisions
- Ship subtitle repositioning v1 as presets + vertical slider instead of drag-and-drop to reduce complexity and improve mobile/accessibility support.
- Gate theater mode behind existing login state and show a disabled control + hint to encourage sign-ins.
- Keep theater mode client-side only (no backend/API changes), since subtitle overlay is already DOM-based in the webapp.

## Next Steps
- Collect local user feedback on theater mode sizing, dim intensity, and exit interactions.
- Validate subtitle position presets/range with different subtitle lengths and larger font sizes.
- Consider optional v1 polish: analytics for subtitle position usage, or minor UI spacing tweaks on small screens.
